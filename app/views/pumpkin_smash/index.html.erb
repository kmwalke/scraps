      What is the Pumpkin Smash?
    </legend>
    <p>
      Scraps-to-Soil holds the Pumpkin SMASH each year to explore composting and ways to contribute less to the waste
      stream. We get “hands-on” with tons of techniques for pulverizing pumpkins into pieces, including the Gallagher
      mallets, Louisville Sluggers, the Trebuchet launcher and the SlingShot. No matter the smash technique you choose,
      you will contribute to the continuance of a community-wide composting crusade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next Pumpkin SMASH is the 11th annual and is going to be on Saturday, November 2nd from 12 to 4pm at the Idaho
      Springs Ball fields. We will have the smashing stations, food vendors, beer & rootbeer, informational booths,
      Pumpkin Pinata, Pumpkin bowling, Obstacle Course, Bouncy house, Chicken POO Bingo, Lucky Bucket raffle and face
      painting!
    </p>
    <p>
      The event will happen rain, shine or snow so come prepared for a November kind of day in the Rocky Mountains. Tell
      your friends and family... DON'T TRASH IT, SMASH IT!! SEE YOU THERE!
