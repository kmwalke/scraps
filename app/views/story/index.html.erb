        Our Story
      </h2>
      <p>
        Scraps-to-Soil is an all-volunteer nonprofit that was founded in 2010. Our goal is to develop a synergistic set of programs that increase access to sustainable and healthy lifestyle options to residents of our communities. This includes constructing and operating community gardens; raising awareness about home gardening and composting benefits; organizing, partnering & supporting workshops and educational programs to give residents the inspiration and skillset to pursue these lifestyle options. The organization has always been light on funding but heavy on volunteerism and enthusiasm.

        How did we get started?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Idaho Springs Community Garden was first opened to the public in the spring of 2011. We had transformed an unused plot of land in the middle of town to a vibrant community space. In 2016 the garden was deconstructed to due to road realignment in the area. It was identified as the most popular amenity in the area during community inputs meeting held by the city. The new garden got rebuilt in 2019 and will be opening its doors to the public in the Spring of 2020. The community garden has been a source of pride and inspiration to many in the community since its inception.

        Where are we going?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Pumpkin SMASH is our annual educational event, it happens the weekend after Halloween. Here we raise awareness about the benefits of composting and other healthy & eco friendly lifestyle options. Everyone is invited to smash their spent jack-o-lanterns using a variety of contraptions and methods so we can then take them to be composted instead of taken to the landfill.
        The Pumpkin SMASH started as a small event brought to the local schools. The first one was on 2008 at Carlson Elementary, on 2009 we also went to Georgetown Community School and realized the impact this event had in kids and the potential it had to educate more people so  on 2010 we opened it to the public by having it at the Idaho Springs Ball Fields.

        We need community members in our conversations, everyone is invited to get involved in the level that feels right for them.
